## Todos
- Remember current Timecyc
- Optimisation
- make gui nicer
- cleanlyness
- nicer way to add new visualsettings

## Issues
- loading always resets to default before applying new timecyc, for compatibility, has optimisation potential
- causes heavy fps drops during loading of timecycle ( no real way to fix this unless you want LOOOONG loading times )
